## Typical installation ##

On a reasonably fresh system, installation is straightforward. To compile,
this is what you need to do:

```
 sudo apt-get install libsndfile-dev libflac-dev libzita-convolver-dev \
                      libfuse-dev libmicrohttpd-dev
 make
```

There was a version range in which libsndfile did not work with folve; make
sure make to to have at least libsndfile 1.0.29 (or
[compile it from source][sndfile-src]).

To install in the default location /usr/local/bin, just do

```
 sudo make install
```

.. otherwise specify the alternative location with PREFIX

```
 sudo make PREFIX=/usr install
```


## Older Systems (before ~2014) ##

Older systems, e.g. Ubuntu 10.04 lack sufficiently recent libraries for FUSE
and the zita convolver. In that case, don't install these with `apt-get`; in
fact, better remove the old versions to avoid confusion:

```
 sudo apt-get remove libzita-convolver-dev libfuse-dev
```
.. and compile the latest versions yourself:
```
 # The FUSE library
 cd /tmp
 wget http://sourceforge.net/projects/fuse/files/fuse-2.X/2.9.1/fuse-2.9.1.tar.gz
 tar xvzf fuse-2.9.1.tar.gz
 cd fuse-2.9.1/
 ./configure
 make
 sudo make install
```

also

```
 # The Zita convolver
 cd /tmp
 wget http://kokkinizita.linuxaudio.org/linuxaudio/downloads/zita-convolver-3.1.0.tar.bz2
 tar xvjf zita-convolver-3.1.0.tar.bz2
 cd zita-convolver-3.1.0/libs
 make
 sudo make LIBDIR=lib install
```

Now, the compilation step described in *Typical installation* should succeed.



## Linking statically ##

To install Folve on some embedded systems (e.g. a NAS), you might need to link
it statically. This depends a lot on your system, so it might require some
twiddeling, but let's see the basic steps.

First, you need to create a static version of the zita-convolver libray; the
default installation does not provide this. To do so, first start
with compiling *The Zita convolver* yourself, as described in the
*Older Systems* section.

Then run the following commands:

```
 # .. afer compiling as described in 'Older Systems' do:
 cd /tmp/zita-convolver-3.1.0/libs
 ar rcs libzita-convolver.a zita-convolver.o
 ranlib libzita-convolver.a
 sudo install -m 644 libzita-convolver.a /usr/local/lib
```

Now we can compile Folve statically:

```
 cd /directory/where/folve/git/is/checked/out
 make clean
 make LINK_STATIC=y
```

The last step might fail if there are additional dependencies. Add them in the
`ifdef LINK_STATIC` section of the Makefile.
