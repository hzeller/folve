# This creates the reverb sampled in Santa Lucia Basilica
# in Bologna, Italy. Impulse recording (C) Angelo Farina.
# The offset 1400 cuts off the direct sound, to be mixed
# in separately. This is recommended for reverb use, as
# the IR was measured using a gun shot, and consequently
# the frequency response is not really flat.
